Description: The CommonMark specification <https://github.github.com/gfm/> defines
    a rationalized version of markdown syntax. This package uses the 'cmark' 
    reference implementation for converting markdown text into various formats
    including html, latex and groff man. In addition it exposes the markdown
    parse tree in xml format. Also includes opt-in support for GFM extensions
    including tables, autolinks, and strikethrough text.
